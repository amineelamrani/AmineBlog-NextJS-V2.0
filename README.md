# Amine Blog APP - Built using NextJS

This is the clone of the Application I have built so far using react and Node (MERN stack) in this [link](https://github.com/amineelamrani/Amine-Blog-MERN).

In this Attempt I am going to build it using nextjs, for SEO constraints and performances and for learning purposes as well to improve my skills on nextjs.

### Steps on building the app :

1. Start by home page and articles reading that doesn't necessitate an authenticated users (home page, search, blog pages).
2. Implement authentication (JWT and Oauth) like the one I have implemented on my app.
3. make it working and respect SEO best practices (for SSG, ISR, SSR...).

[[Next step]]

- Add the pages that doesn't necessitate authentication (home page + Blog pages + search : respect SEO best practices(home page ISR and Blog pages only ssg I guess but what about if there is a modification so I guess there wont be a lot of modification so maybe ISR would help as SSG is not that optimal because there will be new blogs to add so a _*subject of discussion and analysis*_))
